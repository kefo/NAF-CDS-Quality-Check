Quality Check for CDS Daily Names Files

This package provides a way to run a set of quality checks over a collection of MARC/XML records.  The number of records affected are tabulated and the results displayed on screen and emailed to one or more recipients.

There are files included to assist with the retrieval of MARC/XML Names CDS files from an FTP server and save them to a local directory.  It can be used as a cronjob.

The application/ directory is a small XQuery application for the MarkLogic Application/Database Server.  It does not require a database.  Only an application server is needed.  The application/ directory should be the server root.

The MARC/XML files are read from the local directory.  They can be processed individually via the web interface.  There is also an option to upload a MARC/XML file.  

The rules are defined in the constants.xqy file.  They are embedded XQuery that is "eval"uated in turn.
